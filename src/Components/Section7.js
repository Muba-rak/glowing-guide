                        <p>We're doing this challenge, because we KNOW that when you have success selling your products through funnels, you're
                        <span className='underline_text'>more likely to continue to use ClickFunnels</span> to grow your company...</p>

                        <p>That's it... <span className='bold_text underline_text'>that's our "evil" ulterior motive</span> - 
                        for you to have success so you keep using our software that is giving you that success.  </p>

                    Plus, we also pay our affiliates who refer people to this challenge $100 for anyone they signup. Chances are you found out about this page 
                    from one of those affiliates. So, <b>we actually lose money for each person who joins the challenge.</b>

                <div>
                    And the few of you who signup without an affiliate telling you about this challenge, 
                    you probably found out about it because I paid for an ad on Facebook or Youtube to get you here.
                </div>
                <div>Either way, I REALLY make very little, and in most cases lose money for each person who joins this challenge. </div>
                <div><b>So, why would I do this? </b></div>
                <div>Because we have a philosophy here at ClickFunnels, that <u><b>if we can't make you money, then we don't deserve any of yours. </b></u> </div>
                <div>So our goal is to help you make money... then hopefully you'll chose 
                    to re-invest some of those profits back into the products and services that we sell.  </div>
